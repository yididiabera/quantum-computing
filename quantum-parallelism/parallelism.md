When I first read about quantum parallelism, it sounded confusing. But here's how I think about it now: instead of testing one input at a time like a normal computer, a quantum computer can test all possible inputs at once in an entangled kind of way. It does this using superposition.

Let’s say we have 3 input bits. That means there are 8 possible combinations: 000, 001, 010, ... all the way to 111. A classical computer would check them one by one. But in quantum computing, with just 3 qubits put into superposition, we represent all 8 inputs at the same time. That's quantum parallelism.

That’s where the Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm comes in. It gives example to prove this quantum power. Here's the challenge:

> We’re given a function that either always returns the same answer (like all 0s or all 1s), or it returns 0 for half the inputs and 1 for the other half. Can we tell which type it is?

With a regular computer, we’d need to try at least half the inputs to be sure. But with quantum computing, using parallelism and interference, we can get the answer in just one run. I found that super cool.

The algorithm works like this:

- We set the qubits into superposition (using Hadamard gates),
- Feed them through this "mystery" function,
- Then apply Hadamard again to create interference that reveals whether the function is constant or balanced,
- Finally, we measure the qubits. If all are 0s, it’s constant. If not, it’s balanced.

It’s fast, kind of magical, and honestly, still a bit weird to me. But the fact that this tiny algorithm can do in one step what a normal computer needs multiple steps to do—that’s when quantum computing started to feel real.

Still wrapping my head around it, but it’s making more and more sense.
